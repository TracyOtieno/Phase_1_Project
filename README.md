# Phase_1_Project


# Aircraft Fatal Injury Analysis

 # Overview

This project analyzes the trends and patterns of aircraft accidents, specifically focusing on total fatal injuries. The dataset includes information about the date of the accidents, types of aircraft involved, and the number of fatal injuries. Visualizations are created to uncover patterns in fatal injuries across different aircraft categories and over time.

 # Features

- Time Series Analysis: Analyze the trend of total fatal injuries over time.
- Categorical Analysis: Compare average fatal injuries by different aircraft categories.
- Interactive Visualizations: Visualizations are created using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to generate clear and insightful graphs.
- Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and prepared for analysis using `Pandas`.

 # Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language for analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Used for creating basic plots and customizing visuals.
- Seaborn: For creating informative and aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.

 # Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/TracyOtieno/Phase_1_Project
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE

# Results
1.	Safety Insights: Relationship Between Number of Engines and Injury Outcomes
2.	Risk Evaluation: Patterns Between Fatal and Serious Injuries.
3.	Identifying Opportunity: Uninjured vs. Minor Injuries in Less Severe Accidents
